Why Better Tree
ðŸŒ² It helps you understand directory structures at a glance. The tree view reveals nesting, folders, and important files in a compact layout. It makes it easier to compare layouts between folders and to spot anomalies like missing files or odd nesting.

Why this project matters
- Speed matters in the terminal. A tree that takes too long to render breaks your rhythm.
- Customization matters. No two terminals are the same. People run Better Tree on Linux, macOS, and Windows in WSL.
- Predictability matters. The output should be stable across runs, so you can automate checks and pipelines.

Core concepts
- Tree model: The tool builds a lightweight in-memory model of a directory tree. It respects symbolic links by default but can follow them if you opt in.
- Rendering: The renderer produces a text-based tree. It uses a consistent layout so you can scan lines quickly.
- Human-friendly highlighting: Directories, files, and special items can be colorized or indexed to improve readability.
- Configurability: Most aspects of the view are adjustable. You can tailor color, depth, and what to show or hide.

Getting started
- You can run Better Tree directly in your terminal after download. It is designed to be simple to use, with sensible defaults.
- Basic idea: point the tool at a path and let it render a tree that fits your terminal width.

Installation
- Prebuilt binaries
  - The project ships prebuilt binaries for common platforms. For Linux and macOS, youâ€™ll typically download a single executable. For Windows, youâ€™ll get a .exe file.
  - Example file names you might encounter:
    - better-tree-linux-x86_64.AppImage
    - better-tree-macos-arm64
    - better-tree-windows-x86_64.exe
  - From the releases page, download the binary for your platform and execute it. The binaries are self-contained and require no separate installation.
- Building from source
  - If you prefer to build from source, youâ€™ll need the language runtime and build tools specified in the repo. The build process is straightforward and designed to be repeatable.
  - Typical steps:
    - Install dependencies
    - Clone the repository
    - Run the build command
  - The build will produce a binary you can run directly in your shell.
- Quick note about executables
  - After downloading the binary, grant execute permissions if needed:
    - chmod +x better-tree-linux-x86_64.AppImage
  - Then run it:
    - ./better-tree-linux-x86_64.AppImage
  - If you are on Windows, run the .exe from a shell or explorer, depending on your setup.
- What you get with a binary
  - A fast, self-contained CLI tool
  - A clean tree view of the specified path
  - Optional color output and formatting
  - Stable behavior across environments

Quick usage
- Basic usage
  - Better Tree shows the directory tree for the current path by default.
  - Command:
    - better-tree
  - To view another path:
    - better-tree /path/to/directory
- Depth control
  - Use --depth or -d to limit how deep the tree goes.
  - Example:
    - better-tree --depth 2
- Include hidden files
  - Use --all or -a to include hidden files and folders (dotfiles).
  - Example:
    - better-tree -a
- Include or exclude file types
  - You can filter by file extensions or directories to show only what you need.
  - Example:
    - better-tree --include-ext .js,.ts
- Output formats
  - The default output is a plain tree. You can request a JSON view for processing in scripts.
  - Example:
    - better-tree --output json
- Color and styling
  - Enable or disable color with --color or --no-color.
  - You can select a color palette if your terminal supports it.
- Sorting and ordering
  - Customize how entries are sorted. For example, by name, size, or type.
  - Example:
    - better-tree --sort-by name
- Symlinks
  - Choose how to render symbolic links. Either show the link targets or show the link itself.
  - Example:
    - better-tree --follow-symlinks
- Performance considerations
  - For very large directories, use a depth limit and streaming mode to keep memory usage predictable.
  - If you run into performance issues, consider using a narrower scope or a smaller path.

Deep dive: options and flags
- General options
  - --version : print version
  - --help    : display help and usage
- Path and scope
  - path: the directory to render
  - --depth N or -d N: limit depth to N
  - --max-files N: limit the number of files shown per directory
  - --max-dirs N: limit the number of subdirectories shown
- Display and formatting
  - --color / --no-color
  - --theme <name> : choose a color theme
  - --indent <spaces> : set indent width
  - --show-type : show whether an item is a file or directory
  - --show-permissions : display POSIX permissions when available
- Filtering
  - --include-ext <exts> : comma-separated extensions to include
  - --exclude <patterns> : comma-separated patterns to exclude
  - --include <patterns> : include only items that match
- Output control
  - --output <format> : text, json, yaml, or csv
  - --stream : stream results progressively
- Performance
  - --cache-size <bytes> : tune in-memory cache size
  - --threads <n> : control parallelism
- Accessibility
  - --label <text> : add a label to the header
  - --wrap-width <n> : wrap lines at n characters
- Advanced usage
  - You can pipe the output to other tools
  - Example:
    - better-tree /path | grep "src"
- Error handling
  - On errors, the tool prints a concise message and returns a non-zero exit code.
  - You can enable a verbose mode to get more details when debugging.

Rendering and output formats
- Text view
  - The default is a clean, readable tree with indentation that mirrors directory depth.
- JSON and YAML
  - For automation, you can request JSON or YAML output. This makes it easy to integrate with scripts and CI pipelines.
- CSV
  - If you need to feed a spreadsheet or a data tool, CSV can be useful. Each row represents a path element with fields like name, type, and depth.
- Custom formats
  - If you require a bespoke format, you can implement a small adapter around the raw data structure. The internal data model is straightforward and predictable.

Performance and scaling
- Reasonable defaults
  - The defaults aim to render quickly for typical work directories.
  - If a directory is very large, you can reduce depth to keep response times short.
- Memory usage
  - The in-memory representation is small by design. It avoids loading every file attribute unless needed.
- Streaming mode
  - For very large structures, streaming mode renders portions of the tree as they become available. This reduces latency and memory pressure.
- Platform considerations
  - On Windows with WSL or on macOS, the behavior is consistent, but file system semantics can affect performance in corner cases.
- Profiling and tuning
  - If you need to profile, run in verbose mode and capture timing data. The tool exposes hooks to measure render time and CPU usage.

Customization and themes
- Color themes
  - Light, dark, and high-contrast themes help readability in different environments.
  - You can define custom color mappings for directories, files, and special items.
- Custom tokens
  - You can mark certain directories as important, using a custom label or an icon.
- Iconography
  - File and folder icons can be customized, or you can disable icons for a minimal look.
- Font and glyph support
  - If your terminal supports ligatures and extended glyphs, you can take advantage of that to improve readability.
- Accessibility
  - High-contrast themes and higher indent spacing help users with visual challenges.

Extensibility and plugins
- Plugin architecture
  - The tool supports lightweight plugins that can extend rendering, filtering, or output formats.
- How to write a plugin
  - Plugins implement a small interface that the core calls during rendering.
  - They can override color schemes, provide custom icons, or inject data into the output.
- Examples
  - A plugin could add a cache layer to speed up repeated renders.
  - Another plugin could integrate with a log viewer to show directory changes over time.

Configuration and dotfiles
- User-level configuration
  - A config file can live in the userâ€™s home directory, under a well-known path.
  - YAML or JSON formats are supported for readability and tooling compatibility.
- Project-level configuration
  - You can place a local config in a project directory to tailor behavior to that project.
- Common options in config
  - depth, color, theme, include extensions, exclude patterns
- Examples
  - A sample config might set a default depth of 3 and enable color by default.
  - Another sample might enforce showing only JavaScript and TypeScript files.

Troubleshooting
- Common issues
  - The binary wonâ€™t start: ensure the file is executable (chmod +x) and the architecture matches your system.
  - Output is garbled: check your terminal font and width. Some fonts donâ€™t render all glyphs correctly.
  - Color disappears: verify that your terminal supports colors and that color is enabled in the config.
- Debug tips
  - Run with --help to verify youâ€™re using the correct flags.
  - Run in verbose mode to see internal steps and timing.
  - Check for known issues on the Releases page or in the repository issues.

Testing and quality assurance
- Unit tests
  - Tests cover core rendering logic, edge cases, and filtering behavior.
- Integration tests
  - Tests verify the end-to-end behavior with actual directory trees.
- Performance tests
  - Tests measure render time for directories of varying sizes.
- CI
  - The repository uses a continuous integration pipeline to verify builds and tests on every pull request.
